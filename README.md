### (Kode With Klossy final project)

## Description

Worked with two other scholars to create a web-app aiming to make traveling safer for students. Used HTML/CSS/JS skills gained from class to build a product that matches students with other students based on proximity and class times in order to make sure students have 'Travel Buddies', expecially at night, following the 'Safety in Numbers' principle.
